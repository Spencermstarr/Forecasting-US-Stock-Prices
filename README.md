# Forecasting-US-Stock-Prices
# This project is being done as an assigned individual project for a graduate course in 
# big data analytics in my Masters of Science program in Data Analytics Engineering at 
# George Mason University.
# My goal here is to practice working with several of the fundamental regression and classification
# models I have learned in this program (as this is my final course) by comparing their performance
# in how well they are able to forecast the performance of US Stocks.

# I used a high usability rated Kaggle dataset with annual data on US stocks with over 200 candidate
# predictors for each of an average of 4k stocks for 5 separate years from 2014 to 2018.
